Data acquisition was according to Carmona-Higuita et al. (2024). Here we provide a subset of the data derived from GBIF (GBIF.org, 2025).

Cleaning process was carried out as indicated in the source, the single difference is that we updated the taxonomic scrubbing (uniforming synonyms) using a backbone for epiphytes (Mendieta-Leiva G. personal communication), which is based on EpiList (Zotz et al. 2021) and updated according WFO June 2024 release (WFO 2025) and Ferns and Lycophytes List of September 2024 (Hassler et al. 2024). Because the epiphyte backbone does not contain families or genera, these were added to the standardized list, using the command "WFO.match.fuzzyjoin" from the WFO package (Kindt, 2020). The original names as provided by GBIF can be found on the column "spec.name.ORIG". 
Any inconsistencies between WFO output and the epiphyte Backbone were corrected manually, therese were mainly concerning fern and lycophytes (as we followed Hassler et al. (2024).

We joined two dataframes, the dataframe with ocurrence data based on Carmona-Higuita et al. (2024) with the dataframe of assigned families and genera deduced from the search on WFO, to identified them we added strings on the columns. We added '_wfo' to identify the columns from  the dataframe original ocurrence dataframe (standardized using the backbone) and '_fam' to identify the dataframe with families and genera information (they were joined by the field in common "spec.name.ORIG").

The colum "acceptedNameUsageID_wfo" contains the IDs of species accepted by WFO, according to the Backbone.

#Adds an ID column for each record.
#Rearranges the columns to move the ID to the first position.
#Splits the scientificName column into genus (G), species (S), and any extra information.
#Combines the genus and species into a new column called binomial.
#Recombines the scientificName column without the extra information.
#Filters out records where the species field is empty.
